- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Michael-Fredriksson from Sweden
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and dog training
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m self-taught in HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, but IÂ´am now taking a Fullstack course in HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP and Python to be able to get a certificate of knowledge as proof of my knowledge
<!--- - ðŸ“« How to reach me ... --->

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have since 2010 primarily worked with dogs, and have created simpler web pages in my spare time. In 2017 I was tasked with creating a competition system for a growing dog sport and have since developed and maintained the system. In 2022, I received an assignment from another dog club to create their competition system as well.
I have created the competition systems based on PHP and mysql.<br><br>
Recently, I have started to talk about and see a developing opportunity to primarily start working with web development and have therefore started training in order to get a certificate and receipt for my skills.
