- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Michael-Fredriksson from Sweden
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and dog training
- ðŸŒ± From the beginning, Iâ€™m self-taught in web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
At the end of 2023 I decided that I wanted to invest in web development full-time and am therefore taking several Fullstack courses to develop myself and really learn in depth about HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP and Python and to be able to get a certificate as proof of my knowledge

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have since 2010 primarily worked with dogs, and have created simpler web pages in my spare time. In 2017 I was tasked with creating a competition system for a growing dog sport [Swedish Nose Work Club](https://snwktavling.se/) and have since developed and maintained the system. In 2022, I received an assignment from another dog club [Swedish Hoopers Club](https://shoktavling.se/) to create their competition system as well.
I have created the competition systems based on PHP and mysql.
